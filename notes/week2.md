why distributed computing
- big data continues to grow
- applications becoming data-intensive
- lack resournces on individual computers

how to do that
- express a problem as parallel processes to execute of different machines
- let different machine exchange information
- let the processes synchronized and agree on shared value
- enhance reliability
- recover from partial failure
- secure communication, rights to access
- extend interfaces to mimic behavior of another system, reduce platforms diversity
