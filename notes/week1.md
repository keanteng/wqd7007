what is data
- collection of information

big data characteristics
- value, volume, vareity, velocity

characteritics
- volume
    - large amount of data
- velocity
    - analysis of streaming data
- variety
    - different forms of data
- veracity
    - make sure the data is accurate
- variability
    - data meaning is constantly changing
- visualization
    - present data using graphs and charts
- value
    - get business insights and know your customer

big vs small data
- store in one instituion/ computer or file vs multiple internet servers
- highly structured data vs capable of absorbing unstructured data
- user prepare own data for own purposes vs data from diverse sources prepared by many people
- kept for limited time vs must be stored in perpetuity
- one set of standard units vs manmy different electronic formats
- repeatable projects vs seldom feasible
- limited costs vs expensive
- row and column vs inscrutable
- analyze together at once vs analyzed in incremental steps

phases of big data
- data generation
- data acquisition
- data storage
- data analysis
- data visualization or interpretation
- decision making

big data applications obstacles
- data representation
    - improper representation will reduce data value
    - enable efficient operations on different datasets
- redundancy reduction and compression
    - reduce indirect cost of the entire system
- data lifecycle management
    - data freshness
    - which should be stored and which is going to be discarded
- anatytical mechanism
    - identified compromising solution between RDBMS and non-relational database
- data confidentiality
    - use professional or tools to enhance safety risks
- energy management
- expendability and scalability
    - support present and future datasets
- cooperation
    - make use of experts from different fields to harvest the big data potential
